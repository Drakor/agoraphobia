Minecraft Agoraphobia
=====================

Minecraft Agoraphobia is a Minecraft Survival Series where we get to safely stay indoors and/or underground at all times and only have our computers (OpenComputers) and robots to do the bidding for us in the scary outside of the Minecraft Overworld.

[The video series on youtube can be found here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb6UbFXBdbCq5GEcOtXiDmnd3qGAv-h6e)

## List of Mods

The playthrough uses mostly vanilla Minecraft with the addition of OpenComputers:

- [Minecraft Forge 1.12.2](http://files.minecraftforge.net/)
- [OpenComputers](https://oc.cil.li/) ([Documentation](https://ocdoc.cil.li/))

Since the OpenComputers mod uses the [Lua Programming language](https://www.lua.org/), it is worth checking out the [documentation](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/), if you want to follow along.
